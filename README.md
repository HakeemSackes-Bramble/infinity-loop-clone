<h2>UPDATE ::::</h2>

* Woow its been years since i've touched this project lol. I'm happy that I was able to take a game that I like to play and make my own   version. But it's time to make it better!! first step towards that goal is to turn that future feature sitting up there present one.so   here we go.
* <h3>the objective:: <b>more colors</b></h3>
  <i>you said that genius lol</i>
  
  ** first! create objects/methods that detects various closed loops in game whenever a loop is created by player
  
  ** second! properly fill those closed loops while respecting those black borders(and not melting the cpu in the process. <i>Keep it linear Hakeem lol!!!</i>).
  
  ** finally! enjoy playing this great quarantine game with the finest the most vibrant, brilliant, beautiful colors to ever grace this tranquil tapestry, this magnificent mural, this decadent depiction, this... this  ehh you get the point, it'll be awesome lol trust me i'm a developer :)  :)
